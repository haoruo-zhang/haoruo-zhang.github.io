I am currently a research fellow in [Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), working under the guidance of [Mateo Díaz](https://mateodd25.github.io/). I also collaborate with [Tim Kunisky](http://www.kunisky.com/) and [Mauricio Velasco](https://mauricio-velasco.github.io/webpage/). I received my **M.S. in Data Science** from the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at Johns Hopkins, and my **B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics** from [Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en). For more details, please see my [CV](../assets/cv.pdf).

I am broadly interested in optimization, particularly its theoretical foundations and applications in applied mathematics and data science. My current work focuses on understanding the structure of polynomial and semidefinite optimization problems and designing scalable algorithms for high-dimensional settings. In the future, I plan to continue developing optimization methods that strike a balance between theoretical guarantees and practical scalability.

Beyond Academics
======
Outside of my research, I am a competitive powerlifter and currently hold the Asian record. You can find me [here](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/haoruozhang). I also enjoy making music, which has been a long-term personal pursuit.
