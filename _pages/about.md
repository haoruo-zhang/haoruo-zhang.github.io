I am currently a research fellow in [Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), working under the guidance of [Mateo Díaz](https://mateodd25.github.io/). I also collaborate with [Tim Kunisky](http://www.kunisky.com/) and [Mauricio Velasco](https://mauricio-velasco.github.io/webpage/). I received my **M.S. in Data Science** from the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at Johns Hopkins, and my **B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics** from [Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en). For more details, please see my [CV](../assets/cv.pdf).

I am broadly interested in **optimization** and its applications to applied mathematics and data science.  
In particular, my current projects center on:  
- Developing scalable algorithms for high-dimensional polynomial problems.  
- Studying moment relaxations (SOS hierarchy), including both their theoretical foundations and practical implementations.  
- Leveraging algebraic geometry insights to certify optimality and guide algorithm design.  

My future research aims to explore several directions:  
- Developing and analyzing pseudo-moment relaxations as scalable alternatives to classical SOS moment hierarchies.  
- Applying polynomial optimization tools to fundamental combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut.  
- Investigating how insights from high-dimensional statistics can inform initialization and algorithmic performance.  
- Bridging theory and practice by adapting these methods to real-world applications in data science and applied mathematics.  

I am deeply grateful to my mentors for their guidance and support throughout my research journey. In particular, I would like to thank [Mateo Díaz](https://mateodd25.github.io/), [Tim Kunisky](http://www.kunisky.com/), and [Mauricio Velasco](https://mauricio-velasco.github.io/webpage/) for their invaluable advice, encouragement, and inspiration along the way.

Beyond Academics
======
Outside of my research, I am a competitive powerlifter and currently hold the Asian record. You can find me [here](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/haoruozhang). I also enjoy making music, which has been a long-term personal pursuit.
