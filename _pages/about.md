I'm currently a research fellow in [Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) under the guidance of [Mateo Díaz](https://mateodd25.github.io/). I completed **M.S. in Data Science** in [Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). Before that, I completed my **B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics** at [Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en).

Research interests
======
I am broadly interested in **optimization** and its application to applied mathematics and data science. In particular, my current work focuses on **polynomial optimization** and **semidefinite/moment relaxations (SOS hierarchy)**, especially in developing scalable algorithms and exploring their connections to algebraic geometry.

Acknowledgements
======
I am lucky to receive advice and learn from [Mateo Díaz](https://mateodd25.github.io/), [Tim Kunisky](http://www.kunisky.com/), and [Mauricio Velasco](https://mauricio-velasco.github.io/webpage/).

Curriculum vitae 
======
You can find my CV (here)[../assets/cv.pdf].

Beyond Academics
======
Outside of my research, I am a competitive powerlifter and currently hold the Asian record. You can find me [here](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/haoruozhang). I also enjoy making music, which has been a long-term personal pursuit.
