Education
======
* M.S. in Johns Hopkins University, 2025
* B.S. in Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, 2023

Research Experience
======
* **Sep 2024 – Present: Research Assistant**  
  * Johns Hopkins University  
  * Research Topic: Polynomial optimization via the **Product-of-Measures (POM) framework**  
  * Duties included:
    - Advanced the theoretical development of the POM framework as a scalable alternative to traditional SOS/moment hierarchies, targeting high-degree and large-scale polynomial optimization problems  
    - Investigated structural connections between POM relaxations, **SOS/moment hierarchies**, and **algebraic geometry certificates**, with a focus on rank-1 moment vectors and Dirac measure representations  
    - Designed algorithms to decompose global SDPs into local subproblems using tensor-product measures, enabling more efficient computation without sacrificing global optimality guarantees  
    - Conducted numerical experiments on benchmark and non-SOS polynomials (e.g., Motzkin polynomial), demonstrating both feasibility and interpretability improvements over classical approaches  
    - Explored the role of algebraic certificates (e.g., Markov–Lukács forms, secant varieties) in certifying low-rank solutions, bridging optimization with tools from algebraic geometry  
  * Supervisor: [Mateo Díaz](https://mateodd25.github.io/)  


* **Spring 2024: Research Project – Music Emotion Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks**  
  * Johns Hopkins University  
  * Duties included:
    - Designed and implemented deep learning models (RNN, BRNN, and LSTM) to classify music into four emotional quadrants based on **Russell’s Emotion Model**  
    - Extracted and engineered 14 key audio features (e.g., chroma, MFCC, spectral features) using **Librosa**, preparing datasets of 900 original clips, 3,600 augmented clips, and a large-scale 14,000-clip subset from **MTG-Jamendo**  
    - Conducted comparative analysis of neural network architectures against 12 baseline machine-learning classifiers, highlighting strengths and limitations of RNN-based approaches  
    - Applied **data augmentation** techniques (noise injection, pitch/time shifting, speed variation) to expand datasets, leading to a 20–30% improvement in model accuracy  
    - Evaluated scalability of models across small, medium, and large datasets, identifying trade-offs between simplicity (RNN) and complexity (LSTM/BRNN) for generalization performance  
  * [Project Paper (arXiv:2405.06747)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06747)

* **Jun 2022 to Sep 2022: Research Assistant**
  * Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University
  * Research Topic: Personal Thermal Comfort During Exercise 
  * Duties included:
    - Designed a research protocol to measure participants’ thermal comfort during cardiovascular exercise  
    - Created regression models to assess the relationship between thermal comfort and heart rate  
    - Utilized multilayer perceptron models to process data, revealing that heart rate partially reflects activity intensity
