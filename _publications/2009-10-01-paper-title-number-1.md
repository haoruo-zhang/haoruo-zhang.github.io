This project investigates the application of recurrent neural networks (RNN, BRNN, LSTM) to predict emotions in music, based on **Russellâ€™s Emotion Quadrant**.  
We curated datasets of 900 clips, augmented them to 3,600 samples, and applied feature extraction via **Librosa**.  
Our experiments demonstrate that while baseline models can be competitive, RNN-based approaches benefit significantly from **data augmentation** and larger datasets, improving accuracy by up to 30%.  

This research highlights the intersection of **machine learning, affective computing, and music therapy**, with applications in **personalized music recommendation systems**.
